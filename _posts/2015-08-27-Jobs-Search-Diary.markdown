2015 was a struggling time for me as I was looking for a job and the market was so bad for IT position in Toronto. Here are some notes that I took back then to organize my search:

27 Aug 2015
I went for an interview for application developer - DevOps Automation specialist position. I was suppose to meet H and D and arrived 10 minutes earlier. I met with H and D was missing, following is my interview notes:


**Checked in time and met with H, She asked me very little about my skills and then startedtalking about the position in more details. The more she talked about the position the more I lose interest in this position. Then she mentioned that the guy doing technical interview was busy and can't join us today. Comon, I mean I am the only person in the world that had a lot of time for interviews and always available when you call me.**
